# TensorFlow Image Classification

This project contains a simple image classification model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

## Features

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Achieves test accuracy around 70â€“80%
- Easy to modify and extend for custom datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python tensorflow_image_classification.py
```

## Dataset

[CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is automatically downloaded by TensorFlow.
